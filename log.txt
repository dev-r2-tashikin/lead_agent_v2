encyclopedia\\nISO standard\\n**ISO 13485** _Medical devices --[Quality management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management_system "Quality management system") -- Requirements for regulatory purposes_ is a voluntary standard,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-1) published by [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") (ISO) for the first time in 1996, and contains a comprehensive quality management system for the design and manufacture of [medical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device "Medical device"). The latest version of this standard supersedes earlier documents such as EN 46001 (1993 and 1996) and EN 46002 (1996), the previously published ISO 13485 (1996 and 2003), and ISO 13488 (also 1996). \\nThe current ISO 13485 edition was published on 1 March 2016.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-2)\\n## Background\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_13485&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")]\\nThough it is tailored to the industry\\\'s quality system expectations and regulatory requirements, an organization does not need to be actively manufacturing medical devices or their components to seek certification to this standard, in contrast to the automotive sector\\\'s [ISO/TS 16949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/TS_16949 "ISO/TS 16949"), where only firms with an active [request for quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_quotation "Request for quotation"), or on the bid list, of an [International Automotive Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Automotive_Task_Force "International Automotive Task Force") supply chain manufacturer can seek registration.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-3)\\n## Reason for use\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_13485&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Reason for use")]\\nWhile it remains a stand-alone document, ISO 13485 is generally harmonized with [ISO 9001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9001 "ISO 9001"). A principal difference, however, is that ISO 9001 requires the organization to demonstrate [continual improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement "Continual improvement"), whereas ISO 13485 requires only that the certified organization demonstrate the quality system is effectively implemented and maintained. Additionally, the ISO 9001 requirements regarding [customer satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction "Customer satisfaction") are absent from the medical device standard.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-4)\\nISO 13485 places specific emphasis on resource and environment management, tailored to the medical device and software sectors. For example, the standard requires organizations to ensure that their personnel are not only qualified but also adequately trained to understand and implement regulatory requirements. Moreover, the infrastructure and work environment must support compliance and safety. In software engineering for medical devices, this extends to maintaining cybersecurity measures and ensuring a development environment free from potential risks to data integrity or software reliability. \\nOther specific differences include: \\n  * the promotion and awareness of regulatory requirements as a management responsibility. Examples of market-specific regulatory requirements include 21 CFR 820, the Quality System Regulation for medical devices sold in the United States, enforced by the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration "Food and Drug Administration") (FDA), or the [Medical Devices Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Devices_Directive "Medical Devices Directive") 93/42/EEC, required for doing business in the European Union\\n  * controls in the work environment to ensure product safety\\n  * focus on [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management "Risk management") activities and [design control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_controls "Design controls") activities during product development\\n  * specific requirements for inspection and traceability for implantable devices\\n  * specific requirements for documentation and validation of processes for sterile medical devices\\n  * specific requirements for verification of the effectiveness of [corrective and preventive actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_and_preventive_action "Corrective and preventive action")\\n  * specific requirements for cleanliness of products\\n\\n\\nCompliance with ISO 13485 is often viewed as the initial step in ensuring adherence to European regulatory requirements. This is particularly significant when it comes to assessing the conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices in accordance with European Union Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC, and 98/79/EEC before allowing their sale. A fundamental aspect of proving conformity lies in the establishment and implementation of a Quality Management System compliant with ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 14971. While it\\\'s important to note that the European Union Directives don\\\'t explicitly mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485, it is the preferred approach for demonstrating compliance to these standards, and this certification is issued by specialized organizations referred to as "Registrars." \\nFurthermore, some of these registrars also serve as Notified Bodies, which play a pivotal role in the pre-market assessment of certain medical devices. When a Notified Body conducts a thorough evaluation and issues a positive assessment, it results in the coveted certificate of conformity, granting the CE mark and the authorization to market the medical device within the European Union. It\\\'s important to underline that the Notified Body\\\'s assessment scrutinizes the company\\\'s Quality Management System in great detail, along with a meticulous review of the requisite Technical Documentation. This comprehensive evaluation is a crucial element that the Notified Body takes into account when granting the certificate of conformity for the company\\\'s product or products. \\nIn summary, the journey to compliance with European regulatory requirements for medical devices entails a multi-faceted approach, with ISO 13485 serving as a cornerstone and the involvement of Notified Bodies as a key step to gain the necessary certifications and permissions for market access in the European Union. \\nThis standard adopted by CEN as EN ISO 13485:2003/AC:2007 is harmonized with respect to the European medical device directives [93/42/EEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Devices_Directive "Medical Devices Directive"), 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EC.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-5)\\nISO 13485 is now considered to be inline standard and requirement for medical devices even with "[Global Harmonization Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Harmonization_Task_Force "Global Harmonization Task Force") Guidelines" (GHTF).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-6) The GHTF guidelines are slowly becoming universal standards for design, manufacture, export and sales of various medical devices. The GHTF has been replaced in the last few years by the [International Medical Device Regulators Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Medical_Device_Regulators_Forum&action=edit&redlink=1 "International Medical Device Regulators Forum \\\\(page does not exist\\\\)") (IMDRF)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-7) and is structured differently from the GHTF as only the regulators, that are primary members of the group, get to make many of the decisions. The IMDRF main membership (the regulators) do want to have non-regulators involved without voting rights and in this way they are hoping to get the process and documents completed quicker than under the GHTF system (regulators & non-regulators were equal in voting rights) that worked reasonably well, but somewhat slow. \\nThis standard adopted by CEN as EN ISO 13485:2012 is harmonized with respect to the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-8)\\nMexico published on October 11, 2012, a national standard as a [Norma Oficial Mexicana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Oficial_Mexicana "Norma Oficial Mexicana") (NOM) to control manufacture of medical devices inside the country. NOM-241-SSA1-2012, Buenas Practicas de Fabricación para Establecimientos dedicados a la Fabricación de Dispositivos Médicos.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_note-9) The scope of application is mandatory in the national territory, for all establishments dedicated to the process of medical devices marketed in the country. The [Cofepris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Commission_for_the_Protection_against_Sanitary_Risk "Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk") is the body assigned to its control, verification and to grant the records of compliance to the companies that implement this Standard of Good Manufacturing Practices. This standard is partially in line with ISO 13485: 2003 and ISO 9001: 2008. \\nIn 2017, The Farmacopea de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States Pharmacopoeia), medical industrial sectors and Cofepris are working together for updating NOM-241 Standard, putting special attention on managing risks during manufacture and regulating by manufacturing lines some of the most important medical devices manufacturing processes. This standard will be published in August 2018, and 180 days after publication it will become mandatory for the industry. \\nIn Spain, medical devices are named in ISO-13485 as "Sanitary Products" as Castellano-language translation of ISO-13485, but in Mexico they are known as "Medical Devices" and correspond to those used in medical practice and that meet the definition established by NOM-241 as: Medical device, to the substance, mixture of substances, material, apparatus or instrument (including the computer program necessary for its proper use or application), used alone or in combination in the diagnosis, monitoring or prevention of human or auxiliary diseases in the treatment of the same and of the disability, as well as the employees in the replacement, correction, restoration or modification of the anatomy or human physiological processes. Medical devices include products of the following categories: medical equipment, prostheses, orthotics, functional aids, diagnostic agents, supplies for dental use, surgical, healing and hygiene products. ISO 13485:2016 Certificates meets the requirement of IEC 60601-2-25 : 1993 + A1: 1999 safety of Electrocardiograms. \\n## Chronology\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_13485&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Chronology")]\\nYear  | Description   \\n---|---  \\n1993 | EN 46001 _Quality systems – Medical devices – Particular requirements for the application of EN ISO 9001_ is published by the [European Committee for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Committee_for_Standardization "European Committee for Standardization") (CEN), forming the basis for developing ISO 13485.   \\n1996 | ISO 13485 (1st Edition).   \\n2000 | EN ISO 13485 is published by CEN, creating a European Norm version of the international standard, and the previous European standard (EN 46001) is withdrawn.   \\n2003 | ISO 13485 (2nd Edition).   \\n2012 | EN ISO 13485 is revised so that it harmonizes with the three European directives associated with the medical sector: 93/42/EEC (medical devices), 98/79/EC (_in vitro_ diagnostic medical devices), and 90/385/EEC (active implantable medical devices).   \\n2016 | ISO 13485 (3rd Edition).   \\n## See also\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_13485&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: See also")]\\n  * [ISO 14971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14971 "ISO 14971")\\n  * [Good manufacturing practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_manufacturing_practice "Good manufacturing practice")\\n  * [List of International Organization for Standardization standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Organization_for_Standardization_standards "List of International Organization for Standardization standards")\\n\\n\\n## References\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_13485&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: References")]\\n  1. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_ref-1)** ["FOREWORD - SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION"](https://www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html). _www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html_.\\n  2. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_13485#cite_ref-2)** ["ISO 13485:2016 - Medical devices -- Quality management systems -- Requirements for regulatory purposes"](https://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=59752). _www.iso.org_.

It can also be used by internal and external parties, such as certification bodies, to help them with their auditing processes.\\n#### Certification to ISO 13485\\nLike other ISO management system standards, certification to ISO 13485 is not a requirement of the standard, and organizations can reap many benefits from implementing the standard without undergoing the certification process. However, third-party certification can demonstrate to regulators that you have met the requirements of the standard. ISO does not perform certification.\\nRead more about [certification](https://www.iso.org/certification.html "Certification") to ISO’s management system standards.\\n#### Why was ISO 13485 revised and what are the main improvements?\\nAll ISO standards are reviewed every five years to establish if a revision is required in order to keep it current and relevant for the marketplace. ISO 13485:2016 is designed to respond to the latest quality management system practices, including changes in technology and regulatory requirements and expectations. The new version has a greater emphasis on risk management and risk-based decision making, as well as changes related to the increased regulatory requirements for organizations in the supply chain.\\n[![Cover page: ISO 13485:2016 - Medical devices - A practical guide](https://www.iso.org/obp/graphics/pub/f93d0a55-efec-43b8-b711-197fdba60a0b_9e81d6c0ab4f3d45e36f4a09915cca41.jpg) ](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100422.html)\\n[ISO 13485:2016 - Medical devices - A practical guide](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100422.html)\\nHandbook intended to guide organizations in the development, implementation and maintenance of their quality management system in accordance with ISO 13485.\\n[![Cover page: ISO 13485 - Quality management for medical devices](https://www.iso.org/obp/graphics/pub/e9476913-50c9-4ed5-8b10-029a18338533_cff91349ff4fc5fea30b969ae8b34c67.jpg) ](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100377.html)\\n[ISO 13485 - Quality management for medical devices](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100377.html)\\nA free brochure with tips for getting started with ISO 13485, requirements for quality management systems related to medical devices.\\n##### Transitioning to ISO 13485:2016\\nLearn more about how to transition from ISO 13485:2003 to ISO 13485:2016 in this [transition planning guidance document](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/standards/docs/en/white_paper_-_iso_transition_planning_guidance_for_iso_13485-2016.pdf "Transition planning guidance document ") [PDF] developed by the technical committee.\\n[![](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/news/News_archive/2019/12/Ref2465/clinic-1807543.jpg/thumbnails/300x300) ](https://www.iso.org/news/ref2465.html "Reducing the risks of medical devices: international guidance just updated")\\n[Reducing the risks of medical devices: international guidance just updated](https://www.iso.org/news/ref2465.html "Reducing the risks of medical devices: international guidance just updated")\\n18 December 2019\\nVirtually no medical procedure is without risk, but there are many ways to minimize it.

[ISO 13485 certification](https://www.nqa.com/en-gb/resources/blog/february-2017/a-guide-to-iso-13485) is a valuable credential put in place to keep professionals and customers safe in clinics, hospitals and other medical settings.\\nISO 13485:2016 is based on the ISO 9001 process model approach and is a management systems standard specifically developed for the manufacture of medical devices. Its primary objective is to facilitate harmonised medical device regulatory requirements. The standard contains specific requirements for manufacture, installation and servicing of medical devices and calls for:\\n  * Implementation of a Quality Management System with several enhancements\\n  * Risk Management approach to product development and product realisation\\n  * Validation of processes\\n  * Compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements\\n  * Effective product traceability and recall systems\\n\\n\\nThis standard allows companies to reduce safety and legal risks while creating more economical work environments. As an internationally recognised standard of quality and safety for medical device manufacturing, having ISO 13485 certification helps companies get recognised as more reputable, trustworthy providers. The most recent version of ISO 13485 is reviewed every five years and revised according to the new requirements and needs of the industry.  \\n  \\nISO 13485 has seen a 33.1% increase in worldwide certificates in 2020, showing the growth and importance of UKAS accredited certification in recent times. Statistics straight from the most recent [ISO Survey](https://www.iso.org/the-iso-survey.html).  \\n  \\n**Looking to implement an ISO 13485 management system? Not sure where to start?

ISO 13485 contains requirements that are essential for any organization operating at any tier in the medical device and pharmaceutical supply chain, including design, production, installation, storage, development and service.\\nISO 13485 certification is especially relevant to manufacturers that wish to demonstrate applicable regulatory requirements and by organizations whose services support medical device manufacturers. These companies need to get certified to ISO 13485.\\n### Is ISO 13485 Certification Right For Me?\\nISO 13485:2016 is based on the ISO 9001 process model approach and is a management systems standard specifically developed for the manufacture of medical devices. Its primary objective is to facilitate harmonized medical device regulatory requirements.\\nAnnex B of the ISO 13485:2016 standard includes a comparison with ISO 9001 for reference. Importantly, neither can be used to make a QMS that is automatically compliant to the other and both need auditing.\\nFurther, there are many terms in ISO 13485 unique to medical devices. ISO 13485 also retained the role of a quality representative to top management, where ISO 9001 removed this in many aspects. Interestingly, ISO 9001 has a lot more requirements for monitoring external providers for performance than the old version, and this is something always required by ISO 13485.\\nISO 13485 is also ideal for companies that provide parts and services for medical device manufacturers. The standard has requirements for traceability, identification, risk assessment, cleanliness and documentation of procedures, all of which position these enterprises to be strong sources for medical components. Since there are many regulatory requirements by which medical device manufacturers must evaluate and monitor their suppliers, the presence of ISO 13485 certification will help medical device manufacturers feel confident about working with these parts and services providers.\\nApart from medical devices, businesses in the aerospace industry seek to get certified to ISO 13485 to diversify. Those with AS9100 are already set up to achieve ISO 13485 easily.\\n### Facts About the Changes to ISO 13485\\nISO 13485:2016 is a standard that focuses on the importance of the lifecycle of a medical device, including its design, development, production, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and final decommissioning. The standard is designed to assist organizations in focusing their management system and therefore practices on strengthening its risk management approach and meeting regulatory requirements. The following is a major revision of the ISO 13485:2016 standard.\\n  * ISO 13485:2016 replaces ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 13485:2012. \\n  * The standard is aligned with ISO 9001:2008 and not ISO 9001:2015. This misalignment is due to the revision of both standards being completed parallel to one another and because ISO 9001:2015 was determined to be unnecessary for medical devices.\\n  * The changes were managed by the ISO technical committee 210, whose role it was to ensure that this quality management system standard remains fit for purpose. This update was necessary given developments over recent years with product-specific requirements outlined in device directives, such as the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC and the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) 93/42/EEC.\\n  * The standard is in line with the three European medical device directives, and the Z annexes at the front demonstrate where they align. However, the Medical Device Regulations are now live and replaced the medical devices directives in 2020 will replace the in-vitro diagnostic devices directives in 2022. Therefore, it is very likely that an amendment or corrigendum to ISO 13485:2016 will be released in the near future to incorporate two new Z annexes demonstrating how it aligns with the new Regulations.\\n  * Manufacturers who get certified to ISO 13485 address regulations such as the EU Medical Device Directive and the EDU Medical Device Regulation while demonstrating a commitment to medical device quality and safety.\\n\\n\\n### FAQs About the ISO 13485 Standard\\nHere are the answers to the most common questions about ISO 13485 certification:\\n**What Does it Mean to be ISO 13485 Certified?**\\nA higher level of quality control is achieved than ISO 9001 alone and closely matches the requirements for a QMS needed in the EU and UK medical device regulations. It also may carry more favor with medical device manufacturers if you have the standard as a supplier of components for them.\\n**Is ISO 13485 Mandatory?**\\nNo, but as above, it closer meets requirements in the regulation and may better meet the requirements of your customers if they manufacture medical devices. \\n**What’s the Difference Between EN ISO 13485 and ISO 13485?**\\nEN is the Euro Norm, and virtually the only difference is the inclusion of the Z Annex, which highlights which of the regulation elements the standard helps to achieve. \\n**What is a Class 3 Medical Device?**\\nClass III medical devices are the highest risk level of medical devices and typically include devices that support or maintain life. These require a notified body to review the technical file and permit sale by application of a CE mark, amongst other activities. \\n**Why is ISO 13485 Important?**\\nTo implement a QMS with a higher level of control, focus on safety and tougher requirements and standards which can benefit the manufacture of medical devices or components for them.\\n##  Steps to Certification \\n  1. ### Step 1\\nComplete a Quote Request Form so that we can understand your company and requirements. You can do this by completing either the online quick quote or the online formal quote request form. We will use this information to accurately define your scope of assessment and provide you with a proposal for certification. \\n  2. ### Step 2\\nOnce you’ve agreed to your proposal, we will contact you to book your assessment with an NQA Auditor. This assessment consists of two mandatory visits that form the Initial Certification Audit.

This could represent an opportunity to connect with the combined entity as a potential client for IVD products used in their properties (e.g., clinics, healthcare facilities).\\n*   The mention of specific individuals (Natasha Voase, Jack Sidders) as authors of the Bloomberg article could be useful for direct contact or further research.\\n*   The article mentions the UK healthcare sector, which can lead to further research and identification of potential distributors specializing in that market.\\n*   Bloomberg\'s products like Bloomberg Law, Tax, Government and NEF might contain information about the IVD market, regulatory changes, or potential players.\\n*   Bloomberg\'s media channels like Bloomberg Markets or Bloomberg Technology may report on companies in the IVD space.\\n", \'https://www.corumgroup.com/insights/growing-healthtech-ma-market\': "Here\'s a summary of the provided HTML content, focusing on information relevant to an IVD industry B2B brand looking for distributor leads:\\n\\n# Healthtech M&A Market Growth (August 19, 2025)\\n\\nThe healthtech M&A market is experiencing rapid growth, with financial and strategic buyers targeting companies offering products and technologies in areas like AI diagnostics, electronic health records (EHR), surgical robotics, and telehealth. In the first half of 2025, there were 277 M&A deals, on pace to exceed 2024\'s 467 deals. Disclosed deal value reached $10.3 billion in H1 2025, projected to surpass 2024\'s $19.2 billion. Four megadeals exceeded $1 billion in value.\\n\\n## Drivers of Healthtech M&A:\\n\\n*   **Advances in Technology:** AI, data analytics, EHR, and telemedicine improvements are driving deals. Examples include Gleamer acquiring Pixyl and Caerus Medical (AI-powered MRI), and Juvenescence purchasing Ro5 (AI drug discovery). Cotiviti acquired Edifecs (healthcare data interoperability).\\n*   **Consolidation in Healthcare:** Healthcare organizations are consolidating to improve efficiency and market share, leading to M&A activity in healthtech. The merger of Northwell Health and Nuvance Health highlights this. Surgimate\'s acquisition of ImplantBase (inventory logistics and sales operations software) exemplifies streamlining workflows. Consolidation also increases the need for cybersecurity. Datavant acquired Ontellus (health records retrieval and claims intelligence) to address data security needs.\\n*   **Regulatory Changes:** The cost and complexity of regulatory compliance drive M&A for tech companies offering compliance solutions. Abacus Group merged with Medicus IT, and Axonius acquired Cynerio (medical device security) to address these needs.\\n*   **Interest by PE Investors:** Private equity firms are actively investing in healthtech, targeting companies with advanced technologies. Examples include Clearlake Capital acquiring ModMed, Bain Capital acquiring HealthEdge, and New Mountain Capital acquiring a majority stake in Access Healthcare.\\n\\n## Summary:\\n\\nThe healthtech M&A market is expected to remain strong due to the need for innovation, efficiency, and improved patient care. Strategic and financial buyers will likely continue acquiring companies with advanced technologies and solutions.\\n\\n## Potential Distributor Leads (Inferred):\\n\\nBased on the information provided, potential distributor leads may be found among companies involved in the following areas:\\n\\n*   **AI-powered diagnostics and imaging (X-ray, mammography, MRI):** Look for companies developing or using AI in medical imaging. Gleamer, Pixyl, and Caerus Medical could be relevant, although two have been acquired.\\n*   **Healthcare data interoperability:** Companies focused on securely connecting and managing health data. Edifecs could be a point of contact after being acquired by Cotiviti.\\n*   **Surgical management and coordination software:** Companies streamlining surgical workflows. Surgimate (post-acquisition of ImplantBase) is a key player.\\n*   **Medical device cybersecurity:** Companies providing cybersecurity solutions for medical devices and healthcare organizations. Axonius (post-acquisition of Cynerio) is a potential contact.\\n*   **Electronic Health Records (EHR) and AI-powered solutions:** ModMed (acquired by Clearlake Capital) is a potential target, although their distribution strategy may have changed post-acquisition. HealthEdge (acquired by Bain Capital) is also relevant.\\n*   **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM):** Access Healthcare (majority stake acquired by New Mountain Capital) could be a partner or competitor, depending on their geographical focus.\\n\\n", \'https://karmahealthcare.in/\': "  * [(+91) 80080 80851](tel:+918008080851)\\n  * info@karmahealthcare.in\\n\\n\\n  * [ ](https://www.facebook.com/eDoctor.KarmaHealthcare)\\n  * [ ](https://twitter.com/kmhcare)\\n  * [ ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-RSIiyGQR_eihWpVdB6Ug/featured)\\n  * [ ](https://in.linkedin.com/company/karma-healthcare)\\n\\n\\n[ ![Image](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/assets/logo_new.png) ![Image](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/assets/karma_logo.png)](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/)\\n  * [Home](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#hero)\\n  * [About](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#about)\\n  * [Services](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#service)\\n  * [Partners](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#partners)\\n  * [Contact](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#contact)\\n  * [Media](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#media)\\n  * [Get Free Quote](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#appointment)\\n\\n\\n[Get In Touch](https://karmaprimaryhealthcare.in/#appointment)\\nKarma Primary Healthcare\\n# Bridging the Primary Healthcare Gap, _Digitally_\\nImpact-driven, award-winning healthcare start-up, working towards providing equitable access to quality primary healthcare.
